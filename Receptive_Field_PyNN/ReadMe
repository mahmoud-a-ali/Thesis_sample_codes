This is my current work for my master thesis using pyNN (python for Neural Network), it is not finished yet.
the main three files are:
1. n_rtna_cls.py:
	contains the definition of the retina class, which simulate a silicon retina with certain width and hight.

2. n_rf_cls.py:
	contains the definition of the receptive field class, number n of receptive fields can be generated with different orientation.  

3. n_2rtna_4rf.py:
	contains the main code to instaniate 2 retina each one is connected to 4 receptive field with different orientation (0, 45, 90, 135)

other files to implement some functions that is used very often when dealing with spiking neural network using pyNN:
	- cnvt_rslts2TDXY: convert the results generated by spinnake-NEURON simulator- from neuron spikes with specific ids to 2D grid coordinates so it can be animated.
	- anmy_TDXY: animate the resullts of the simuation.
